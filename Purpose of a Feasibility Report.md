#### Purpose of a Feasibility  Report
The whole purpose behind doing feasibility report is to understand all of the various variables that are involved in projects as well as seeing what the reaction would be once they are released onto the market for general audiences as well as the required target market. Additionally, it is used to recognise what factors will be key in making it a success within the market. The report focuses on the main objective of the project whilst also considering any alternative choices that could be made. After the collection of this data, decisions can be made on which path should be pursued in order to make the project as profitable as possible for the company.
#### How Technical Solutions can be compared
The way technical solutions can be compared is by checking the following:
- The difficulty in finding a solution.
- Skills that are required in order to solve the problem that arises.
- How effective the solution is, as a solution that creates more problems cannot be considered as a solution.
- How long it takes to integrate the solution into the program.

# Sequential and Iterative SDLC




The following are Examples of Sequential and Iterative Lifecycle Models.

# Sequential
The Sequential model usually progresses through a number of defined phases until they have a product that the client will be happy with.
# Waterfall
The Waterfall method is the most well known sequential Method,it is also referenced as the Linear-Sequential life cycle model. The basic principle in the Waterfall method is that each phase has to be completed before the following phase may start and these phases cannot overlap.

# Iterative
With the Iterative model, the process usually begins with the implementation of a small range of requirements and then enhances these iteratively as the development cycle progresses until the software is ready to be deployed.

# Sequential and Iterative SDLC




The following are Examples of Sequential and Iterative Lifecycle Models.

# Sequential
The Sequential model usually progresses through a number of defined phases until they have a product that the client will be happy with.
# Waterfall
The Waterfall method is the most well known sequential Method,it is also referenced as the Linear-Sequential life cycle model. The basic principle in the Waterfall method is that each phase has to be completed before the following phase may start and these phases cannot overlap.

The sequential phases of the waterfall method are as follows:
* Requirement Gathering and Analysis:
This phase is used to determine what the client would like the software to do, so all the possible ways this can be achieved are documented for use when actually developing the software.
* System Design:
the requirements that are obatained in the first phase are then studied in this phase in order to create a system design, this phase allows the company to specify what hardware and system requirements will be required in order to function properly
* Implementation:
* Intergration and Testing:
* Deployment:
* Maintenance:
# Iterative
With the Iterative model, the process usually begins with the implementation of a small range of requirements and then enhances these iteratively as the development cycle progresses until the software is ready to be deployed.
